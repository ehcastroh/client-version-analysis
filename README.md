# Client Version Analysis

## Tenant Version Change Visualization

This project aims to create a visualization that displays the instances when a tenant changed client versions. The visualization is based on the "Timestamp" data, and it utilizes the matplotlib or seaborn library in Python.

### Problem Description

In a system where multiple tenants use different client versions, it is crucial to track when a tenant switches from one version to another. By visualizing these version changes, we can gain insights into the evolution of client versions over time.

### Solution Overview

The solution employs a Python script that utilizes the pandas library to process and analyze the data. It leverages the matplotlib library to create a scatter plot that visualizes the version changes for each tenant.
